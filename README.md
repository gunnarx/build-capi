# build-capicxx-runtimes

Some scripts that build **Common API C++** runtimes, for **-core**, **-dbus**, and **-someip**.

**Warning**: This is written in a simple way, and clones all dependencies including Boost, which is quite big.  
For any production use, you should probably do something smarter.
